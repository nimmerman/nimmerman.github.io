        <h3>EECS 370: Intorduction to Computer Architecture</h3>
        <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs370/eecs370.f15/">Course Website</a>
        <p>This course is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computers execute programs. Understanding computers means understanding the hardware/software process of how you and the computer work together to have the computer carry out a task. In EECS 370, you will see how a low-level language is executed by the hardware, and you will see how to put together basic hardware building blocks to form the functional units of a computer.</p>
        <blockquote>Nathan was a great instructor. He was able to take difficult problems and walk through them in small, easier steps.</blockquote>
        <blockquote> Nathan was very helpful and did a very good job of making discussion both interesting and beneficial!</blockquote>
        <blockquote> The worksheets with the extra practice problems are super helpful!
Also I appreciate going the extra mile and constructing extra problems right on the spot in order to help with students understanding</blockquote>
        <p>Created discussion worksheets to provide extra practive problems and reenfore matrials</p>
        <h2>Courses</h2>
        <h3>EECS 442: Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>Introduction to computer vision: Cameras models, Multiview geometry, edge detection, feature detection, face detection, object and scene recognition, object categorization.</p>
        <h4>Final Project: Detecting image forgeries with inconsistancies in lighting</h4>
        <p> Created a tool that analyzes the light direction of different surfaces within the image to detect whether or not the image is a forgery with the algorithm  outlined in Johnson and Faridâ€™s paper, <i>Exposing digital forgeries by detecting inconsistencies in lighting</i>.</p>

        <h3>EECS 373: Microprocessors</h3>
        <p>Principles and practices of modern embedded systems design. Focus on computer architecture beyond the CPU, fundamentals of the hardware/software interface, techniques for sensing and controlling the physical world, and a few other topics. In lab, we will focus on the ARM Cortex-M3, Actel FPGAs, and other supporting hardware, to learn how to design, build, and program embedded systems.</p>
